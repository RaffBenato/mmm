            >I have been attending Ians circuit classes for 5 months now and
            absolutely love his innovative ideas, planning and his ability to
            capture a full range of exercises! Ian brings a consistent energy to
            the sessions and is able to watch, encourage and drive an individual
            to putting in 100%. Ians enthusiasm and sense of humour while
            running these classes is engaging for us all. I have recently had PT
            sessions with Ian. We have covered a variety of exercises and he
            never fails to demonstrate, or explain enough the technical side of
            each exercise to enable me to reach my full potential. Thanks to Ian
            and his passion for teaching, I have regained confidence and faith
            in myself!

            >Ian is an amazing trainer; I have been attending his weekly circuit
            classes for a while and cannot go without these in my week! Ian is
            very patient and understanding and has helped me through my worst
            and pushes you to your limits and knows when there is more in the
            tank! He supports you when you are going through an injury and the
            best methods to continue your training. I have learnt a lot and
            still learning about my body and techniques to use to get the best
            out of a session.

            >I have attended Ianâ€™s circuit classes twice weekly since October 22
            and no class is ever the same! He puts so much thought into the
            training activities to target different body areas and the classes
            are led with such enthusiasm and encouragement! I would recommend
            Ian to anyone who is looking to improve their fitness in a fun and
            friendly environment.

            >Ian is a truly superb fitness coach. He has an unusual ability to
            make the most onerous sessions great fun and the camaraderie he
            engenders with all members of the group makes you push yourself
            further than you thought possible. The variation he uses in his
            classes makes each one unique and his friendly, professional
            approach is second to none.
